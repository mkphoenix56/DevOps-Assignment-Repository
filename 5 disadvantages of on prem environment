                                  Five Disadvantages of an On-Premises Environment

1) High Initial Costs – Organizations must invest heavily in hardware, software, and infrastructure setup, making it expensive upfront.

2) Limited Scalability – Expanding resources requires purchasing and installing new hardware, which is time-consuming and costly.

3) Maintenance and Management Burden – IT teams are responsible for maintaining servers, applying security patches, and handling system upgrades.

4) Disaster Recovery Challenges – Setting up backups and disaster recovery solutions requires additional investment and expertise.

5) Long Deployment Time – Deploying new applications or expanding infrastructure takes weeks or months compared to the rapid provisioning of cloud-based services.
